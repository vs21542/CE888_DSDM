'in-vehicle-coupon-recommendation.csv' is available at - https://github.com/vs21542/CE888_DSDM/tree/main/data

# Code - 
Recommendation system for in-vehicle coupons implementation code available at - https://github.com/vs21542/CE888_DSDM/blob/main/code/Coupon_Recommendation_Classification.ipynb

Implementation code have following steps:-
1. Data loading and preprocessing
2. EDA
3. Machine learning classification with Random Forest, SVM and Logistic Regression
4. Comparision of classifiers results
